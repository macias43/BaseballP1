Predict future season stats for baseball players using machine learning.  The stat predicts the wins above replacement (WAR) a player will generate next season. By first downloading and cleaning baseball season data using python and pybaseball. And feature selection using a sequential feature selector to identify the most promising predictors for machine learning. Then train a ridge regression model to predict future season WAR, measure error, and improve the model. In the end, the model can predict future season WAR.
